##Teemofy
Teemofy is a chrome extension that replaces every occurance of a known Pro name on Reddit.com to the word "Teemo"

##Why?
The fans of League of Legends are known to be some of the most passionate fans in ESports.  Very often, after live events, when their favorite team let them down, they would go on and bash the pros.  This is NOT OK!  So we created this extension for the pros to use so that it replaces the person being bashed to Teemo, because we all hate teemo :)
